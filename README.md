For this project I made a Barista app where the cashier would sign in and be moved to the cashier page where someone can take orders
they have a select option with a input to put the customer name inside.
after pressing the order button the order is going to go to the barista page which is another page where the barista must sign in 
once seeing the order they press the check mark to finish the order and it will go back to the cashier side where the cashier will be able to know when a order is done.
